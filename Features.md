## Pull Request Plugin

- By design it extensible and new features can be added easily
- Restriction features are not bundled into main code and can be extended separately. Available as API for doing checks from other plugin parts
- Trigger events are splitted to separate classes and can do:
  - Label: added, removed, exists
  - PR states: closed, opened, commit changed
  - Comment triggering
- UI/configuration changes:
  - No tones of checkboxes
  - Trigger section contains only configuration related to triggering
  - All messages configurable
- Publishers are in post-build actions:
  - slitted to separate publishers to have ability choose required order
    - Set build status. Job can configured to not set PR statuses
    - Add labels
    - Remove labels
    - Close PR
    - Post comment with TokenMacro and Groovy Templates from [email-ext-plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Email-ext+plugin) support
- Trigger check modes:
  - Cron checks with persistence
  - Hooks with persistence
  - Hooks with persistance and periodic cron check (to avoid lost events)
  - (TBD) Light hooks triggering without persisting state (penalty: lost events)
- Built sources variants:
  - Build only merged state. Note: merged to target branch only in moment when PR was built.
  - Build only 'head' state. This is what is really contains in PR without merge to target branch.
  - Conditional build with `GITHUB_PR_COND_REF`. When PR is mergeable it contains 'merge' word and 'head' when not.
- Persisted state is stored near build configuration in `*.runtime.xml` file to exclude useless saves with [jobConfigHistory-plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/JobConfigHistory+Plugin)
- All input variables starts from `GITHUB_PR_*`
- Refspec for [git-plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin) is not hardcoded, branch specifier can be constructed using input variables
- Configuration and code tried to be workflow friendly
- Integrated with [github-plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitHub+Plugin) optimized/reused code for:
  - searching projects
  - using one hook url
  - almost one Global Configuration
  - reused credentials lookup
