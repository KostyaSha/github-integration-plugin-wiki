This was started as rewritten version of [ghprb-plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitHub+pull+request+builder+plugin) that after many years was in complex code state when keeping backward compatibility with fixing all bugs almost impossible and makes no sense (IMHO). Code was inspired by github-plugin, git-plugin, ghprb-plugin and others. Other GitHub related features will be made as part of future github-integration-plugin that should also include github-pullrequest-plugin. PR plugin is separate to keep backward compatibility for those who already using it. Experimental features will be in some experimental submodule.
