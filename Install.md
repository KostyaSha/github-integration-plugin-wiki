* The only release now is in [Experimental Update Center](https://jenkins-ci.org/content/experimental-plugins-update-center/).
Which is also the preferred way of installation. 

* If you don't want to change your Update Center, you can the download the `.hpi` from a mirror http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/plugins/github-pullrequest/ and upload it to Jenkins Plugin Manager.
